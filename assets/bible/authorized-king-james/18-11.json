    "Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.",
    "They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.",
    "The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:",
    "Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?",
    "For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.",
    "The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.",
    "Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.",
    "The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted."
