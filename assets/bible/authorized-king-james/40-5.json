    "Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.",
    "He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?",
    "He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.",

    "And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.",
    "And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.",
    "And they did all eat, and were filled.",
    "And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.",
    "And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.",
    "And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.",
    "And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.",
    "And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.",

    "And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,",
    "And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.",
    "And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
