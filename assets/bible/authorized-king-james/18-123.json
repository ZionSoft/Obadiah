    "If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;",
    "If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:",
    "Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:",
    "Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:",
    "Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.",
    "Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.",
    "Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.",
    "Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth."
