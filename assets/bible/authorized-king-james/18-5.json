    "O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.",
    "Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.",
    "My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?",
    "Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.",
    "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?",
    "I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.",
    "Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.",
    "Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.",
    "The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.",
    "Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly."
