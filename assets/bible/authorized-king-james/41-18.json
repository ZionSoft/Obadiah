    "He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.",
    "And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.",
    "But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.",

    "And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:",
    "For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.",
    "And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:",
    "Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?",
    "And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.",

    "Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.",
    "And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.",
    "And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.",
    "And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?",
    "And they said, The Lord hath need of him.",
    "And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.",
    "And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.",
    "And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;",
