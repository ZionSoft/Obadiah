    "LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?",
    "How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?",
    "They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.",
    "They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.",
    "Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.",
    "Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?",
    "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?",
    "He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?",
    "The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.",
    "Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;",
    "That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.",

    "Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?",
    "They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.",
    "But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.",
    "And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off."
