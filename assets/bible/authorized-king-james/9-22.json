    "Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,",
    "The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.",
    "The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.",

    "And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.",
    "And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.",
    "And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!",
    "And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.",
    "And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.",
    "And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.",
    "Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.",
    "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:",
    "And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.",
    "These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.",
    "He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.",
    "Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,",
