    "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.",
    "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.",

    "And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.",
    "And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.",
