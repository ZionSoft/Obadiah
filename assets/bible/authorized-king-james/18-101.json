    "For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.",
    "My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.",
    "By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.",
    "I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.",
    "I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.",
    "Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.",
    "For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,",
    "Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.",
    "My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.",
    "But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.",
