    "The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.",
    "And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.",
