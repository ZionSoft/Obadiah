    "And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?",
    "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.",
    "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.",

    "And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.",
    "And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.",
    "So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.",
    "And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?",
    "And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.",
    "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?",

    "And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.",
    "And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.",
    "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.",

    "And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.",
    "Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.",
