    "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",

    "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.",
    "For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.",
    "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.",
    "Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?",
    "This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.",
    "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.",
    "I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.",
    "And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.",

    "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,",
    "Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,",
    "Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,",
    "Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.",

    "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.",
    "Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
