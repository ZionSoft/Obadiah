    "Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.",
    "Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?",
    "How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?",
    "Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.",
    "How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?"
