    "Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;",
    "And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:",
    "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.",
    "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;",
