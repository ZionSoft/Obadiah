    "Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.",
    "But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,",
    "I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:",
    "Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.",
    "And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.",
    "But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.",

    "And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.",
    "And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.",
    "And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:",
    "And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;",

    "Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.",
    "Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?",
    "When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.",
    "Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.",
