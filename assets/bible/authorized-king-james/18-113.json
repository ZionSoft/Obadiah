    "When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;",
    "Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.",
    "The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.",
    "The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.",
    "What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?",
    "Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?",
    "Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;",
    "Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters."
