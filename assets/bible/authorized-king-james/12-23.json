    "The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,",
    "The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.",
    "These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.",
