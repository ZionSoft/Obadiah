    "Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.",
    "Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.",
    "My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.",
    "For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.",
    "The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.",
    "Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.",
    "But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.",
    "Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.",
    "For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.",
    "Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.",
    "But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.",
    "For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield."
