    "And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;",

    "And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.",
