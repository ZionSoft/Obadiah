    "Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.",
    "O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;",
    "But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.",
    "Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.",
    "The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.",
    "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.",
    "I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.",
    "I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.",
    "Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.",
    "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.",
    "Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore."
