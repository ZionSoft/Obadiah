    "I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,",
    "And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.",

    "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:",

    "And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.",
    "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
