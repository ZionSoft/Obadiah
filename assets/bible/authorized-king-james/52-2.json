    "Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:",
    "And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.",

    "And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.",
    "And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.",
    "Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.",
    "For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;",
