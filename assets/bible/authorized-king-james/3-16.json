    "And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.",
    "And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.",
    "And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.",
